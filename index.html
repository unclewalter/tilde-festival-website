Tilde New Music Festival launched at the beginning of 2014, offering a platform and communal space for new and experimental music practice. This includes modern notated music, free improvisation, sound art, and computer music. We offer a supportive and open space for practitioners in these fields to explore new works, to test out ideas, and to examine how new music branches out into, and indeed is intrinsically linked with, other disciplines such as the visual arts, dance, and theatre.

Tildeâ€™s broad aim is to remove the performance barriers associated with challenging new musical works through the use of open space, taking these adventurous works out of the concert hall and by encouraging the full use of the space by the artists, to engage the audience sonically, visually, and sometimes physically. Our musical focus is on works created in the last 50 years within the Australasian geographic region that push performer and audience in new and interesting ways, and to facilitate new networked connections and spontaneous collaborations between artists and audiences alike.

	Tilde was started by flutist and sound artist <a href="http://www.alicebennett.net" target="_blank">Alice Bennett</a>, and composer <a href="http://www.vgiles.net" target="_blank">Vincent Giles</a>, and was originally conceived of to be a multi-platform project including an academy, and <a href="http://www.tilde.net.au/festival/past-festivals/" target="_blank">festival</a>, though we have been focusing on the growth and expansion of the festival, we hope to launch the academy in the near future.

	Currently Tilde New Music Festival is hosted annually at <a href="http://www.testing-grounds.com.au" target="_blank">Testing Grounds</a> in Southbank, Melbourne.
