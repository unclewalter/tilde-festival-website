The Tilde New Music Festival is an annual celebration of new and experimental music covering notated and improvised music, sound art, and the intersections with other art forms. Held in Melbourne each January, the festival offers a grass-roots atmosphere with food, drink, installations, performances, visual art, discussion, and much more.

Calls for projects and performances at the festival open in July each year, and you can find out more about previous festivals here.

The 2017 festival will be held on Saturday 28th and Sunday 29th January in Melbourne.
