<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information for applicants:</span>

*   In 2016, **Tilde New Music Festival** is hosted at [Testing Grounds](http://www.testing-grounds.com.au): the space is currently being renovated and we do not currently know what technical and stage setup(s) are available. Please don’t let this put you off putting in an EOI, we can try to negotiate and work around any issues that arise. In previous years we have had a shipping container stage with amplification, an indoor studio and a lot of open space. Please contact us if you need help tracking down resources for your project. Even if we don’t have the funds to buy or hire equipment we may know someone willing to lend it.
*   **What we look for from EOIs**:
    *   Experience of practitioner;
    *   Aesthetic and ideological suitability (see below);
    *   Logistics: can we support the project?
*   **Aesthetic considerations:** Tilde promotes contemporary (new – art music), exploratory and experimental music. Our program usually consists of contemporary composers (Australian and international – focusing on Australasia, nothing written before 1965*), electroacoustic performance, improvisation in a free or post-classical style (i.e. not jazz), and inter-disciplinary collaboration (last year we had a dancer, a painter and performance artist). We also have an installation featuring sound art/electronic and computer music.
*   **International and Interstate Applicants**: whilst we welcome EOIs from international applicants, please be aware that we have _no funding to support travel_. We will write letters of support for applicants to apply for funding to travel from other states in Australia, and internationally, and will help to find cheap or couch-surfing-style accommodation from our network here in Melbourne.
*   Tilde runs on **no money at all** and at this stage nobody involved gets paid. If we make some ticket sales, money will go to artists (after expenses are reimbursed). Artists are encouraged to apply to funding bodies for artist fees and any other costs that Tilde is unable to support.
