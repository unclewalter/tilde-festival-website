##Calls for Expressions of Interest in the 2017 festival are now open and will close on 23rd October 2016 at 11:59PM AEST##
Please read the information below before submitting an application, and [contact us](http://www.tilde.net.au/contact/) with any questions.

*   **Calls are open for the following**:
    *   **CLOSED** Projects and performances including notated music, improvisation, installations, and electroacoustic performance. Tilde particularly welcomes submissions featuring solo and ensemble repertoire, female composers and sound artists, and site-specific works.
    *   **CLOSED** Collaborative projects. Artists submit their interest in participating in a collaboration with other festival artists. Groups meet in the weeks leading up to the festival to prepare a 10-minute site-specific performance.
    *   [Fixed-media works](/fixed-media) to be presented at the Festival in the sound installation. Further details on the form. Call closes on the _31st of December at 11:59PM AEST_.

*   **Tilde New Music Festival** is hosted at Testing Grounds in Southbank, Melbourne, and the Australian Institute of music in King Street, Melbourne. Testing Grounds is currently being renovated and will open again in late Spring, 2016. Stay tuned for more information about the new setup and tech specs.
*   Please contact us if you need help tracking down resources for your project. Even if we don't have the funds to buy or hire equipment, we may know someone willing to lend it.
*   **What we look for from EOIs**:
    *   Experience of practitioner;
    *   Aesthetic and ideological suitability (see below);
    *   Logistics: can we support the project?
*   **Aesthetic considerations:** Tilde promotes contemporary (new – art music), exploratory and experimental music. Our program usually consists of contemporary composers (Australian and international - focusing on Australasia, nothing written before 1967*), electroacoustic performance, improvisation in a free or post-classical style (i.e. not jazz), and inter-disciplinary collaboration (previously we have had dancers, painters, animators, and performance artists). We also have an installation featuring sound art/electronic and computer music.
*   **International and Interstate Applicants**: while we welcome EOIs from international applicants, please be aware that we have _no funding to support travel_. We will write letters of support for applicants to apply for funding to travel from other states in Australia, and internationally, and will help to find cheap or couch-surfing-style accommodation from our network here in Melbourne.
*   Previously Tilde has run on no money at all and at this stage nobody involved has been paid. If our recent funding applications are successful, all artists will be remunerated for both performances and rehearsals. Artists are encouraged to apply to funding bodies for any costs that Tilde is unable to support, and we will be happy to write letters of support for this purpose.



*Unless programming older but little-heard works
