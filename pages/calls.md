*   Please contact us if you need help tracking down resources for your project.
*   **What we look for from EOIs**:
    *   Experience of practitioner;
    *   Aesthetic and ideological suitability (see below);
    *   Logistics: can we support the project?
*   **Aesthetic considerations:** Tilde promotes contemporary (new – art music), exploratory and experimental music. Our program usually consists of contemporary composers (Australian and international - focusing on Australasia, nothing written before 1969*), electroacoustic performance, improvisation in a free or post-classical style (i.e. not jazz), and inter-disciplinary collaboration (previously we have had dancers, painters, animators, and performance artists). We also have an installation featuring sound art/electronic and computer music.
*   **International and Interstate Applicants**: while we welcome EOIs from international applicants, please be aware that we have _no funding to support travel_. We will write letters of support for applicants to apply for funding to travel from other states in Australia, and internationally, and will help to find cheap or couch-surfing-style accommodation from our network here in Melbourne.



*Unless programming older but little-heard works
