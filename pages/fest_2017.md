## Ticket information
**Festival Pass:** The Festival Pass is a limited-run of passes that allow priority entry into all ticketed events, goes toward our running costs, and also offers a significant discount over what it would cost to pay for each performance individually. Any remaining Festival Passes will be available until sold out on the day.

**Individual Performances:** On the day of the Festival, all *outdoor* performances are free, but the two indoor venues are ticketed and will be available at *$10 per performance.*

**Payment Options:** The festival passes are admnistered through EventBrite (see above), which takes payments online. We will take cash only at the doors to the venues, but have EFT/Credit facilities at the main ticketing/information booth to be located at the bar. Bars are good.
