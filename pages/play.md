Tilde Play kids’ workshops are a fun and creative way to learn about sound. They will learn about experimental music and make their own sound compositions. <br />

These workshops will get kids listening actively and exploring new sound worlds. Experimental music’s focus on collaboration, creativity and playfulness provide a fantastic method of music education for children, and these workshops introduce modern music philosophies that are often left out of primary and secondary music education. When all sounds are available for play, children can participate in meaningful musical experiences without having first mastered instrumental skills.<br />

**8-12 Years**

Presented in partnership with Paint What You Hear<br />

This workshop uses contemporary music and visual art to engage young people and adults in the arts, inviting them to respond to live music using painting and drawing. Participants listen to live musicians and respond to the music exploring lines, shape, colour and their own imagination. Children learn about the elements of music and how to represent sound through artistic expression. The workshop is engaging, fun and messy!<br />

**13-16 Years**

Presented by Miranda Hill (3 Shades Black) and Erica Rasmussen (Paint What You Hear)<br />

Participants learn about experimental music and 20th and 21st century philosophies of music: that all sound can be music! They will explore the worlds of serialism, extended techniques, and graphic scores through games and activities, culminating in a short performance.
