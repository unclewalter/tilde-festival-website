## Alice Bennett

Alice Bennett is a Melbourne-based flutist and sound artist who works with electronically manipulated flute, found sounds, field recordings, and improvisation. She performs both written and improvised music and is an Artistic Director of the Tilde New Music Festival. 

## Vincent Giles

Vincent Giles spends his time as a sound artist and composer. His work, whether for the concert hall or the outdoors, a gallery space or a lounge room, for instruments or electronics or both, pays close attention to the influence of space and site on the presentation and reception of the work. Vincent has a keen interest in physics and evolutionary biology, which is a major driving force in his creative work and has lead to doctoral research at the Victorian College of the Arts, University of Melbourne, examining the link between memetics and microsound in sound art.
