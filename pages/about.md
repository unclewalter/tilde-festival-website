Tilde New Music and Sound Art was started in 2013 by Alice Bennett and Vincent Giles, to address the absense of events at the fringes of art music in the southern hemisphere. The first festival was in 2014 and it has grown steadily since then to a biennial, currently eight day event called Tilde New Music Week, encompassing an academy for new music, the festival, and other events. Tilde incorporated in 2018.<br />

# The Direction
Tilde New Music and Sound Art Inc., exists for the promotion and support of contemporary art music and related practices of our time. This encompasses: new notated, semi-notated music, free improvisation, computer music, sonic/sound art, and related disciplines that are future-looking, inventive, and/or boundary-pushing. This aesthetic focus limits works to those composed or created within a 50-year period of any given Tilde event, with the exception of works that: are rarely programmed in other contexts; or that address imbalances in representation, access, and diversity. We aim to program works based on merit of the proposal within the criterion set out by the Artistic Directors.<br />
Tilde aims to reduce inequality in festival and concert programming utilising peer-review procedures, with focus areas (or other mechanisms as decided by the Artistic Directors), to increase diversity of representation and programming in order to create an inclusive space, where marginalised voices can be heard. This allows Tilde to engage with, and present, an active snapshot of artistic activity of our time.

# The Team
Tilde New Music and Sound Art Inc. consists of two directors, a committee of volunteers, and a membership. As an incorporated association it is bound by the Victorian Incorporated Associations Act.

## Vincent Giles - Artistic Director and Manager
Vincent Giles spends his time as a sound artist and composer. His work, whether for the concert hall or the outdoors, a gallery space or a lounge room, for instruments or electronics or both, pays close attention to the influence of space and site on the presentation and reception of the work. Vincent has a keen interest in physics and evolutionary biology, which is a major driving force in his creative work and has lead to doctoral research at the Victorian College of the Arts, University of Melbourne, examining the link between memetics and microsound in sound art.<br />
