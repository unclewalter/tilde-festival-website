Tilde New Music and Sound Art was started in 2013 by Alice Bennett and Vincent Giles, to address the absense of events at the fringes of art music in the southern hemisphere. The first festival was in 2014 and it has grown steadily since then to a biennial, currently eight day event called Tilde New Music Week, encompassing an academy for new music, the festival, and other events. Tilde incorporated in 2018.

## Vincent Giles - Director and Manager
Vincent Giles spends his time as a sound artist and composer. His work, whether for the concert hall or the outdoors, a gallery space or a lounge room, for instruments or electronics or both, pays close attention to the influence of space and site on the presentation and reception of the work. Vincent has a keen interest in physics and evolutionary biology, which is a major driving force in his creative work and has lead to doctoral research at the Victorian College of the Arts, University of Melbourne, examining the link between memetics and microsound in sound art.
