Tickets are available from the Arts Centre Website (see links, and please note the dates and times below when booking your ticket). $15 full/$10 conc.

##In Depth #1: On Improvisation and Spontaneous Collaboration
**Sunday the 15th of January, 2pm to 3:30pm**

**Aviva Endean and Mohamed Kubbara (or Gary Butler)**

Aviva Endean and Gary Butler discuss spontaneous collaborations, and improvisation in a contemporary music setting, with performances. 
Unfortunately we have had to do a last-minute change to this event, and Gary Butler will now be replacing Mohamed Kubbara for a discussion on improvisation with Aviva Endean.

Aviva Endean is a performance-maker, clarinettist and composer interested in expanding the audience experience of sound by creating intimate, unusual and spatially engaged contexts for listening. She challenges standard forms and contexts for performance in order to create new and unexpected ways of engaging with her work. Her performance practice spans a wide variety of musical styles and performance contexts including experimental and improvised music, theatre, creating immersive sonic environments, chamber music, folk music and inter-arts collaborations.

Aviva is the recipient of numerous Awards and grants including the prestigious Freedman Music Fellowship, JUMP mentorship program, the Keith and Elizabeth Murdoch Travelling scholarship, the Willem Van Otterloo memorial award, the Atheneum prize for chamber music and the Lionel Gell Merit award. Her work has been nominted for the EG music Awards ‘best Avant-garde/experimental act’ 2013, and the Aria Awards ‘Best World Music album’ 2014.

Her recent original works include the ‘Intimate Sound Immersion‘, a performance for one blindfolded person at a time (You Are Here festival, The Village festival, Camp Elsewhere) ‘In the Half Light’, a show for solo clarinet and immersive lighting design (presented by ASTRA as part of the JUMP mentorship program) ‘A Face Like Yours’ a sound work for video, foam earplugs and viewer (selected for Sydney Contemporary Art Fair) ‘Dual Rituals’ for clarinets and percussion (Bendigo International Festival for Exploratory Music) ‘The Perfect Human’ for 3 acapella female vocalists and lo-fi lighting (presented by Chamber Made Opera as part of their Little Operations events), ‘Domicile’ a performance installation work inhabiting a family home (New Music Network mini series) and ‘Hapnophobia’ a site specific participatory work for 5x5x5 at the Melbourne Arts Centre.

Gary has been performing improvised music for 20 years. His interest in extending the range of the guitar has led to him rubbing pizza into the strings, throwing a guitar from a 3rd storey window, nailing a guitar to a cross, having food fights with his family on stage, writing a PhD thesis on prepared instruments, playing J.S. Bach’s “Prelude in Dm” and playing/attacking the guitar with various items including (but not limited to) toys, a bird cage, a vibrator, shoes, sticks, polystyrene, fireworks, a battery operated masturbating hand, an axe and a kitchen sink


##In Depth #2: On Audiovisual Performance and Composition
**Monday the 16th of January, 7pm to 8:30pm**

**Brigid Burke**

A performance of TRANSIT Plus by Brigid Burke followed by a discussion of contemporary audiovisual performance and composition.

TRANSIT Plus is series of performance works that consists of Instinct and Episodes, Green Skies….Moments and TRANSIT for Bb/Bass clarinet, electronics and live video. These compositions reference the environment, architecture of the surrounding areas, sonic and visual improvisation/composition with the creation of multi-layered juxtapositions. These three compositions create linkages between location, audience, artist, and cultural/conceptual space. They explore the roles of visual and sonic representation, communicating with the audience in creating a shared surreal/hyperrealism space with tangible moments.

##IN DEPTH #3: On Commissioning, Collaboration, and Solo Performance
**Tuesday the 17th of January, 7pm-8:30pm.**

**Phoebe Green (viola), Ben Opie (oboe), Hannah Reardon-Smith (flute)**

A discussion on commissioning new works, collaborating with composers and performers, and solo performance repertoire by some of Australia's top instrumentalists.


Tickets available [online](https://www.artscentremelbourne.com.au/whats-on/2017/the-channel/tilde-new-music-academy-public-program) or at the Hamer Hall box office.

###Tilde New Music Academy

## An exciting opportunity to learn about the composition and performance of Modern Art music.

**Applications are closed.**

The Tilde New Music Academy is a week-long series of workshops for performers and composers focussing on contemporary art music included notated music, sound art, computer music, and improvisation.

The Tilde New Music Academy aims to:

*   Expose musicians to modern art music
*   Expand musical breadth
*   Show appreciation and enthusiasm for the artform
*   Help practitioners to  engage with and grow this musical genre
*   Encourage young people to steer the direction of this exciting genre

Participants of the Academy have the opportunity to refine their musical practice under tutorage from some of Australia’s leading practitioners in a hands-on, practical environment. The Academy includes lectures on the history and key advents in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, group improvisation, field recording workshops, and networking opportunities. By participating in the Tilde New Music Academy, we will help you engage with and become a part of the challenging music of our time, to take ownership of and steer it into the future, because it belongs to all of us.

### What is new music?

New music is a broad term that describes art music of the late 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries. It is the extension of the classical music tradition; the experimental, exploratory, avant-garde music and sound art of our contemporaries across the globe.

Choose one of two streams:

### Instrumental performance (woodwind, brass, strings)

Performers learn new techniques, explore the music of today’s composers, learn to improvise in a contemporary style, perform with computers and electronics, and see just how far they can push their instruments and their ears. They work with tutors to prepare solo and ensemble works and improvisations for performance at Tilde New Music Festival. Tutor announcements coming soon.

#### Requirements for performance stream

AMEB Grade 7 (or equivalent) or above in any instrument including voice. Applicants are required to submit a CV and list of relevant solo and/or ensemble repertoire that they have previously performed, as well as up to 3 pieces that they wish to study at the Academy.

No age restrictions.

### Composition

Composers are given the opportunity to discuss their artistic practice amongst peers and with feedback from tutors in a supportive masterclass environment. These workshops will delve into the theoretic, philosophic, cultural, and critical means of engaging with a composer's work. Additionally, composers accepted into the composition stream may be considered for special projects (such as computer music or installation) within the program. Details on special projects to be announced. Tutor announcements coming soon.

#### Requirements for composition stream

Applications are assessed by CV and composition portfolio on a case-by-case basis. Participants must have some experience in the composition of new and/or experimental (art) music (see above for a more detailed description of what the Academy covers).
