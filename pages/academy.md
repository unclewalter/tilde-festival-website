TRANSIT Plus is series of performance works that consists of Instinct and Episodes, Green Skies….Moments and TRANSIT for Bb/Bass clarinet, electronics and live video. These compositions reference the environment, architecture of the surrounding areas, sonic and visual improvisation/composition with the creation of multi-layered juxtapositions. These three compositions create linkages between location, audience, artist, and cultural/conceptual space. They explore the roles of visual and sonic representation, communicating with the audience in creating a shared surreal/hyperrealism space with tangible moments.

##IN DEPTH #3: On Commissioning, Collaboration, and Solo Performance

## An exciting opportunity to learn about the composition and performance of Modern Art music.

The Tilde New Music Academy is a week-long series of workshops for performers and composers focussing on contemporary art music included notated music, sound art, computer music, and improvisation.

The Tilde New Music Academy aims to:

*   Expose musicians to modern art music
*   Expand musical breadth
*   Show appreciation and enthusiasm for the artform
*   Help practitioners to  engage with and grow this musical genre
*   Encourage young people to steer the direction of this exciting genre

Participants of the Academy have the opportunity to refine their musical practice under tutorage from some of Australia’s leading practitioners in a hands-on, practical environment. The Academy includes lectures on the history and key advents in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, group improvisation, field recording workshops, and networking opportunities. By participating in the Tilde New Music Academy, we will help you engage with and become a part of the challenging music of our time, to take ownership of and steer it into the future, because it belongs to all of us.

### What is new music?

New music is a broad term that describes art music of the late 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries. It is the extension of the classical music tradition; the experimental, exploratory, avant-garde music and sound art of our contemporaries across the globe.

Choose one of two streams:

### Instrumental performance (woodwind, brass, strings)

Performers learn new techniques, explore the music of today’s composers, learn to improvise in a contemporary style, perform with computers and electronics, and see just how far they can push their instruments and their ears. They work with tutors to prepare solo and ensemble works and improvisations for performance at Tilde New Music Festival. Tutor announcements coming soon.

#### Requirements for performance stream

AMEB Grade 7 (or equivalent) or above in any instrument including voice. Applicants are required to submit a CV and list of relevant solo and/or ensemble repertoire that they have previously performed, as well as up to 3 pieces that they wish to study at the Academy.

No age restrictions.

### Composition

Composers are given the opportunity to discuss their artistic practice amongst peers and with feedback from tutors in a supportive masterclass environment. These workshops will delve into the theoretic, philosophic, cultural, and critical means of engaging with a composer's work. Additionally, composers accepted into the composition stream may be considered for special projects (such as computer music or installation) within the program. Details on special projects to be announced. Tutor announcements coming soon.

#### Requirements for composition stream

Applications are assessed by CV and composition portfolio on a case-by-case basis. Participants must have some experience in the composition of new and/or experimental (art) music (see above for a more detailed description of what the Academy covers). This may include notated and/or electronic music.
