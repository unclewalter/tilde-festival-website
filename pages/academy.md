*   Expose musicians to modern art music
*   Expand musical breadth

Participants of the Academy have the opportunity to refine their musical practice under tutorage from some of Australia’s leading practitioners in a hands-on, practical environment. The Academy includes lectures on the history and key advents in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, group improvisation, field recording workshops, and networking opportunities. By participating in the Tilde New Music Academy, we will help you engage with and become a part of the challenging music of our time, to take ownership of and steer it into the future, because it belongs to all of us.

**What is new music?**

New music is a broad term that describes art music of the late 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries. It is the extension of the classical music tradition; the experimental, exploratory, avant-garde music and sound art of our contemporaries across the globe.

Choose one of two streams:

**Instrumental performance (woodwind, brass, piano, strings, percussion, and voice)**

Performers learn new techniques, explore the music of today’s composers, learn to improvise in a contemporary style, perform with computers and electronics, and see just how far they can push their instruments and their ears. They work with tutors to prepare solo and ensemble works and improvisations for performance at Tilde New Music Festival.

**Composition**

Composers may like to explore musique concrete, or algorithmic music; perhaps even performative computer-based music. Composers participating in the computer music stream are able to develop a new work (or works) over the week for exhibition at the Festival.

**Requirements for performance stream**

AMEB Grade 7 (or equivalent) or above in any instrument including voice. Applicants are required to submit a CV and list of relevant solo and/or ensemble repertoire that they have previously performed, as well as up to 3 pieces that they wish to study at the Academy.

No age restrictions.

**Requirements for composition stream**

Applications are assessed by CV and composition portfolio on a case-by-case basis. Participants must have some experience in the composition of new and/or experimental (art) music (see above for a more detailed description of what the Academy covers). This may include notated and/or electronic music.

No age restrictions.

**Computer music project**

We will be running a special computer music project during the 2017 Academy with an outcome in the Festival. Composition students may apply for this project after being accepted into the Academy.

**Timeline**

Applications open in September. Please check back for more information closer to that time.

The next Academy will be held between **Saturday 14th **and **Friday 20th January 2017** in Melbourne, with performances on Saturday 21st and Sunday 22nd January as part of the Tilde New Music Festival.
