<!-- Description -->
Post 1.0 is an exploration of technology and the question of irrelevance it places on humanity.

Post 1.0 is a system where environmental sound is converted to musical data, fed back through itself, reinterpreted by the computer and sent out to be reinterpreted again and again and again….

The result is a constantly evolving musical texture with little to no human input beyond design.

<!-- Bio -->
Chris Dunn is a multifaceted composer and musician based in Melbourne.
A product of an adolescence obsessed with all things loud followed by a late 20s enamoured with all things quiet, Dunn’s music is one of eloquent contrast.
Absorbing and filtering influences from a vast expanse of genres; ranging from punk, metal and industrial to modernist and minimalist classical music, ambient electronica and film scores – a unique use of extremes and intricacies oft overlooked is revealed in his work.
Dissonant and flowing, fierce and elegiac – a focused and moving body of work continues to evolve.
