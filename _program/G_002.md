<!-- Description -->
Sound installation.
How do you tell nature from other? Or even maybe that long deep feeling of unease when asked questions about strange happenings.
Running on a combination of Max for Live and Ableton Live, cameras detect movement and affect the audio and visual components of the installation accordingly.

<!-- Bio -->
Humphrey Cheung is often obsessed with great washes of sound, and noises that don't quite sound like what they are. The combination of auditory and visual experiences is one Humphrey often uses to express crippling childhood doubts and whimsical adult mania, and his interest in the weird wide realm of electronics enables him to deliver a varied body of work.

Humphrey has had the pleasure of being taught by a diverse network of composers, including Australian composers David Chisholm and Mary Finsterer. Humphrey has written works for various ensembles, most recently including the Sonic Art Quartet from Germany. His art and sound installations have also been sighted at various festivals, including the Tilde New Music Festival.
