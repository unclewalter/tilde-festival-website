<!-- Description -->
Alex’s performance for Tilde Festival will use the 8-channel speaker array at Testing Grounds. Set against the outside ambience of the location, it will feature the visceral, psychoacoustic interactions of sine tones and feedback, spatialised field recordings and the intimacy of her own voice and pulse. (Alex holds the pseudo-scientific belief that electricity might actually be magic). http://alexandraspence.net
<!-- Bio -->
Alex’s art and music explores the idea of listening as an active practice, examining the ways in which our individual notions of place and identity are shaped and mediated through sound. Through her practice Alex attempts to reimagine the intricate relationships between the listener, the object, and the surrounding environment as a kind of communion or conversation. With an interest in resonance, vibration and everyday sound, her aesthetic favours unusual sound sources: small sounds, inaudible frequencies, and object interventions.
