<!-- Description -->
Plane and Field is an installation that harnesses the ‘rainbows’ created by everyday safety glass, encouraging viewers to participate in the incidental delights of our built environment.
Panes of glass have been inserted into an overhead frame throughout the site that, depending on the sun and the time of day, cast a subtle rainbow spectrum onto the scene below.
Visitors to Testing Grounds are encouraged to track the subtle rainbows as they move across the site. The rainbows are visible in the shadows, they may appear in the shadow of a building or under a bench, you can use your own shadow or are invited to use an umbrella to find them.
Plane and Field is based on the observation of glass in the urban environment. Much of the glass used now is safety glass with a polished, arrised edge which acts as a prism. It is this standard edge finish which casts these incidental rainbows. The installation uses this same glass, reminiscent of louvre windows and industrial glass, but strays from its functional application to focus on the rainbow effect.
Plane and Field is a site-specific project based in sculptural practice and is accom- panied by a publication and performance. Further details will be posted here.
This project has been assisted by the Australian Government through the Australia Council for the Arts, its arts funding and advisory body.

<!-- Bio -->
Through the framework of a sculptural practice I work with and respond to sites. A continuing focus of my practice has been developing an expanded understanding of site, where context is crucial and site is positioned as a shifting environment of multiple relations. The sites I am responding to are situated in the construct of the everyday and explore the complexities of the built environment. Often this is with the aim to explore relationships of temporality, narratives and intimacy within space.
