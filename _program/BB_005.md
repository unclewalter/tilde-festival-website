<!-- Bio -->
I am a freelance musician in Melbourne. After studying with Juilliard professor, Rob Nairn via a Penn State university scholarship, I returned to Melbourne and began performing regularly. I have been engaged to perform with ensembles such as Forest Collective, Victoria Opera, Arcko Symphonic, Melbourne Composers' League etc. This year I was engaged as tutor for The University of Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. I use my multi-instrumentalism as an aide to my composition, as well as to spread the horizon of possibilities when curating concerts.
