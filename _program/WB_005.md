<!-- Description -->
Naima has been Artist-in-Residence for Tilde New Music Festival between December 2018 and 2019 and has created a new, site-specific work for Tilde and Testing Grounds. More information coming soon.

Musicians include Katherine Philp and more to be confirmed. 

<!-- Bio -->
Naima explores music, ecology, and the spaces between. Since childhood music and the environment have been her passions. After several years concentrating on ecological work, she returned to composing, only to miss ecology! In the past few years she has been moulding a creative practice that deeply involves both composition and ecology. She is moving beyond familiar compositional processes; and experimenting with cross-arts pieces, new composing techniques and collaborations. She is trying to use her music/ecology meld to reach out to broader communities, hoping her explorations will enable more people to easily access both important ecological information and enriching creative experiences.

Influences include jazz chords; minimalism’s entrancing woven structures; gamelan’s rhythms and microtonality; tonal languages; fractal, harmonic, and microscopic patterns; ecological datasets; anarchism; cultural traditions; intricate natural phenomena; and strong wom*n. She never practices.

Naima is currently composing a piece exploring a work by Ursula Le Guin, commissioned by L.A. composer’s collective, Synchromy; and about to start a residency to compose a site-specific work for the Tilde New Music and Sound Art Festival, 2019. She’s also currently recording and mixing Leagues of Breaking Light and is excited to release it as a multi-media album in 2019. Watch this space!

As well as her data-sonification work Leagues of Breaking Light, Naima has written music for short film; 2 full-length live circus shows (Women’s Circus, Melbourne); Orkeztra Glasso Bashalde (Melbourne community klezmer/balkan+ band); and professional chamber ensembles. She lives in Melbourne where she composes music, reads queer and feminist sci-fi, rides a bicycle as often as possible, and plays music at protests with Riff Raff Radical Marching Band.
