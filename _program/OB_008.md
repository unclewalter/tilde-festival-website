<!-- Description -->
Inharmonic is a series of seven pieces based on the exploration of sound and silence.  Percussive sounds are produced from two nylon string guitars, guitar cases, triangle, and music stands with the assistance of mallets and other tools. The pieces are improvised, therefore the produced sound are variable when rehearsing or performing the pieces. The strings on the guitars remain out of tune, in order to keep sound atonal and exploratory in nature.
