Free improvisation on extended technique ideas.
<!-- Bio -->
Repertoire and free improvising double bassist specialising in acoustic-electronic performance. Coming from a contemporary (rock/jazz) and improvisation background, I have become more grounded within improvisation that favours timbral ideas moving away from traditional jazz improvisation. This also includes representing repertoire (electronic/non-electronic) of Australia composers.
