Trio Improvisation

<!-- Bio -->
I have been performing improvised music for 20 years. My interest in extending the range of the guitar has led to rubbing pizza into the strings, throwing a guitar from a 3rd storey window, nailing a guitar to a cross, having food fights with his family on stage, writing a PhD thesis on prepared instruments, playing J.S. Bach’s “Prelude in Dm” and playing/attacking the guitar with various items including (but not limited to) toys, a bird cage, a vibrator, shoes, sticks, polystyrene, fireworks, a battery operated masturbating hand, an axe and a kitchen sink

“Is there anything you can't do to a guitar?” Jon Rose

“This covers a lot of ground, reminds me of the days when improvising was fun and is satisfyingly real.” Chris Cutler

“For the finale, Butler hacked apart a guitar with a pickaxe . . . He may have looked like a serial killer, but this was about controlled chaos." The Age
