<!-- Description -->
This is a new solo work for self-made post-digital/electronic instrument: Circles. This version is a wooden box that contains a single-board computer and two micro-controllers. Bespoke software is written in Pure Data and Arduino, running on Linux. Sampling is via in-built microphone. Semi-random and quasi-intelligent sequencing and the creative negotiation of imagined agency is the main agenda.

Keywords: random, DIY, Arduino, Pure Data, Linux, open-source, post-digital, embedded computing, music technology.

<!-- Bio -->
John is a post-digital/electronic musician who is also senior lecturer and head of music technology at Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University (QCGU). Prior to this he worked as a visiting assistant professor at Brown University (USA), and previously, a lecturer in creative music technologies at Kingston University (UK). John’s Ph.D. ‘New Relations for the Live Musician?’ was completed in 2009 under the supervision of Bennett Hogg and Sally Jane Norman at Newcastle University (UK). His thesis charts an idiosyncratic zone within the continuum of what it is to be a live musician at the dawn of the 21st century. John’s work is published via Contemporary Music Review, Ashgate, Cambridge University Press, Creative Sources Recordings, and Clinical Archives. As well as academic conferences and festivals such as NIME, ICMC, NYCEMF, BEAM, and SEAMUS, he has presented performance-based works at Borealis Festival for Contemporary Music in Bergen, Open Studio at STEIM in Amsterdam, and Club Transmediale in Berlin.
