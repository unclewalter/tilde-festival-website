<!-- Description -->
My solo project 'Mondo Flockard' explores the electronic manipulation of rhythms played on the drum set, focusing on blending both acoustic and electronic instruments and objects. This creates a dense sound world that uses repetitive melodies coupled with scattered rhythms/textures.
