<!-- Description -->
Extension presents an extended improvised performance by Pedro Alvarez (Chile/WA) on an extended electric guitar, with extended participation of guest performers Phoebe Green (Vic) on viola, and Hannah Reardon-Smith (Qld) on flutes. Extension is a sound journey sustained for an hour through constant extending of the means by which music is spontaneously created.
