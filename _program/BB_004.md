<!-- Description -->
Rosalind Park is central to Bendigo, adjoining the Bendigo Creek, the CBD, a
High School, a Primary School, and a colony of bats. A wonderful space for relaxation but also the site of recent pro and anti-mosque protests. This composition will feature field recordings from this area, often processed to abstraction to create new sounds and textures.

<!-- Bio -->
I am an australian sound artist (french-born, polish parents), based in regional city of bendigo, producing computer-based electroacoustic music, with a particular interest in deconstructing natural sounds (field recordings) to create new sounds & textures. I produce sound & video for theatre, dance, live performance and installation. Although experimenting with sounds since the early 80s, I have pursued sound art more seriously since 1998, with my first live performances in 2000. I also create experimental video. With my wife, fran, I investigated music based on lindenmayer system models of fungal growth
and also set up sound art label cajid media.

I am also passionate about promoting experimental art, hence my past
involvement with the film society movement (bendigo film group (1976-1988)), co-editing arts on fire, a monthly mag for the old fire station arts coop  (1986-88). promotion of experimental music in the local community through the experimental music radio program  possible musics (1983-2013) and the undue noise concert series (2002 - present), serving on the committee of allanâ€™s walk artist run space (2010-11), involvement in live arts group punctum (2004-present) and curating sound-based exhibitions and concerts in central victoria.  

I was a microbiologist in a former life, specialising in the microbiology of wastewater treatment, but left this field in 2004 to concentrate on sound art.
