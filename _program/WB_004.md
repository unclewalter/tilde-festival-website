<!-- Description -->
Fortify is a piece for a solo improviser that examines noise; particularly its relationship and contexts within pitch and rhythm. The piece is constructed from motifs developed as part of my practice as an improviser. These motifs appear as part of a spontaneous set of music, lasting between 30 and 35 minutes. These themes are developed from a continuing interest in brass multiphonics, rhythmic polyphony, connectivity, and intensity.

<!-- Bio -->
Melbourne-based improviser and composer Brae Grimes forges his music by taking risks. The audience experiences the silence from which the harmony is imagined, the air before a tone is thrummed. These are the risks Grimes injects into each performance.

Grimes first developed a passion for music in regional Queensland brass bands, and would often get stern looks from his teacher and early mentor Mel Nielsen for adding (unnecessary) harmonies, inflections, and ornaments. This piqued his interest - what could be added to music to make it better, or at the very least, different? This developed into a fledged infatuation with improvisation and composition. His formative luminaries include Scott Tinkler, Paul Williamson, Julien Wilson, Jordan Murray, Marc Hannaford, Tristram Williams, and John Hoffman.

Grimes has been involved as a performer in projects that cover nearly every genre, and in some cases, defy genre altogether. He is a regular performer in the Arcko Symphonic Ensemble, as well as being a composing contributor and performer in Tim Willisâ€™ The End, and leading his own ensembles Brae Grimes 5tet, and The BAD Trio.
