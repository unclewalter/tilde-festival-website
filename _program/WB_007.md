<!-- Description -->
The performer's commitment to commissioning and presenting Australian works that extend the instrument (viola) in unexpected and virtuosic ways continues with Lisa Illean's CRANES. The close collaboration between composer and performer yields a beautiful and special result. Whilst the performer strongly considers the content of female of composers in this recital with the inclusion of Illean and Lim, the emphasis should and always remain on good music. That Illean and Lim are female are not the "catch" but their language and artistry are high examples of individuality and originality. Billone's ITI KE MI at times is almost a explosion and an expulsion of the female voice; its frailty, its strength, its viciousness, dramatically spitting and spluttering to the end. The viola begins to take on an empowered voice of its own gaining momentum until last final choke.
