<!-- Description -->
Ponguru (sonorous, resonant, deep –toned, gruff) is a unique New Zealand recorded work conceived, composed and performed by ngā taonga pūoro (traditional Māori musical instruments) artist Al Fraser and double-bassist Phil Boniface that brings together the low voice of the double-bass, as well as the many voices of ngā taonga pūoro in an exploration of timbre, space, melody and shared musical language.
