<!-- Description -->
The Forbidden Languages are a set of new solo compositions for extended solo saxophone. Each work is a symbolic, gestural, hypothetical gateway to the musical impression of an indefinable, ephemeral syntax. Idiosyncratic techniques and mechanical quirks of the saxophone are utilized to create a highly foreign, yet intuitive sound world.
