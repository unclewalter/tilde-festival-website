<!-- Description -->
Eigenrau is a brass trio dedicated to exploring the intersection between notated and improvised music traditions with a focus on extended brass mechanics and homogenous group sound.  
Their work for tilde will see them presenting a program of world premiere music from Australian composer Brodie McAllister alongside a collection of improvisations in which the exploration of brass techniques is trawled from one end of the spectrum to the other.

Brodie McAllister - Trombone
Sean Mackenzie - Tuba/Bass Trombone

<!-- Bio -->
Eigengrau is a brass trio from Brisbane whose work is concerned with blurring the lines between notated and improvised music. As a trio they came together in late 2015 as an expression/extension of extended brass techniques developed by Brodie McAllister through his solo explorations and, have since, been working on expanding the repertoire for solo/group brass music in Australia.  
Between the three members they have performed with such acclaimed ensembles as ELISION Ensemble, The Australian Youth Orchestra, Clocked out Duo, BULLHORN, Valtozash Big band and Ben Mark's DMA "Circular ruins".
Each member is a graduate of the Queensland Conservatorium of Music and serve as active members of the Brisbane Classical, New and Improvised music community.
