# About Tilde New Music & Sound Art
Tilde New Music and Sound Art, exists for the promotion and support of contemporary art music and related practices of our time. This encompasses: new notated, semi-notated music, free improvisation, computer music, sonic/sound art, and related disciplines that are future-looking, inventive, and/or boundary-pushing. This aesthetic focus limits works to those composed or created within a 50-year period of any given Tilde event, with the exception of works that: are rarely programmed in other contexts; or that address imbalances in representation, access, and diversity. 

Tilde aims to reduce inequality in festival and concert programming utilising peer-review procedures, with focus areas to increase diversity of representation and programming in order to create an inclusive space, where marginalised voices can be heard. This allows Tilde to engage with, and present, an active snapshot of artistic activity of our time.

# Tilde New Music Week
We celebrate and support modern notated music, free improvisation, sound art, and computer music through a biennial **Festival** and **Academy**, offering a supportive and open space for practitioners in these fields to explore new works, to test out ideas, and to share their insights with the next generation of music makers.
