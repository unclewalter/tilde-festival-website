Tilde New Music and Sound Art: home of new and experimental music.Â 

We celebrate and support modern notated music, free improvisation, sound art, and computer music through an annual Festival and Academy, offering a supportive and open space for practitioners in these fields to explore new works, to test out ideas, and to share their insights with the next generation of music makers.
